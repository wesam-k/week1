How do I create a hidden file or folder? How do I display it in the CLI?
wesam@samoo MINGW64 /c/Users
$ cd wesam

wesam@samoo MINGW64 ~
$ cd week1

wesam@samoo MINGW64 ~/week1
$ mkdir file

wesam@samoo MINGW64 ~/week1
$ attrib +h file

wesam@samoo MINGW64 ~/week1
$ attrib -h  file



How do I create multiple nested directories, like /c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun?

wesam@samoo MINGW64 ~/week1
$ mkdir these/ folder/ are/ just/ for/

wesam@samoo MINGW64 ~/week1
$ ls
 are/  'challengeCLI .txt'   file/   folder/   for/   just/   test/   these/



How do I append a message to a file, without a newline character, so the output would be:


wesam@samoo MINGW64 ~/week1
$ echo "first message" >>homework1.txt

wesam@samoo MINGW64 ~/week1
$ echo "second message" >>homework1.txt

wesam@samoo MINGW64 ~/week1
$ cat homework1.txt


first message
second message
